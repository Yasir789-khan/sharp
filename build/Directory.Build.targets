    Directory.Build.targets is automatically picked up and imported by
    Microsoft.Common.targets. This file needs to exist, even if empty so that
    files in the parent directory tree, with the same name, are not imported
    instead. The import fairly late and most other props/targets will have been
    imported beforehand. We also don't need to add ourselves to
    MSBuildAllProjects, as that is done by the file that imports us.

  <!--
    Manually set the version if null. This is copied from Microsoft.NET.DefaultAssemblyInfo.targets and is needed
    for cases where that target is not being automatically imported (which happens because MSBuild is used instead
    of dotnet build for some cases, due to the solution having some WinUI 3 projects). The lines setting the prefix
    have been omitted, as that is already handled in the root .props file.

  <!--
    Setting this property is needed as a temporary workaround for an MSBuild bug triggered by WinAppSDK,
    around 'GetReferenceTargetPlatformMonikers'. That target is currently producing multiple items and breaking
    the build (in particular here it causes aliases to be lost/overwritten, and to ignore some attributes such
    as 'PrivateAssets', causing potential type collisions across different projects) when compiling projects.
    This can be removed once the bug is fixed in MSBuild and the tooling is updated here (likely VS 17.12).
